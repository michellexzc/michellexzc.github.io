## Risk Factor Mapping  
**Description:** This project was done for a class at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, different risk factors were calculated in order to determine pumpkin sustainability. These maps were made in order to figure out what was happening to the Farmer Merrell's pumpkins. There were several conclusions that could have been drawn, destruction by demogorgons, destruction from other farmers, or unsuitable conditions could have all caused the loss of pumpkins.  GIS network analysis was used in order to figure out the fastest routes from Farmer Merrells farms to other farms, ruling out foul play. Then, demogorgon sightings were plotted on a map, with buffers of 1000 feet (inferring that other demogoron's could possibly be found in the area) and rivers (demogorons hate bodies of rivers) in order to rule out destruction of property by demogorons. Finally, using an query builder, risk factors of pumpkin sustainability were equated to numbers based off the amount of risk, then added together to create a map with all risk factors. Factors that were considered were geology (pumpkins grow best with certain rock types), rainfall (pumpkins grow best in areas of preciptation between x number of inches), landcover (determined by different factors around the region), and slope (pumpkins grow best in x elevation). Once all factors were added into one map, sustainability scores ranged from 6 (best) to 2 (worst). It was found that Farmer Merell's pumpkins were suffering due to poor pumpkin sustainability factors.
