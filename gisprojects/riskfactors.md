## Risk Factor Mapping  
**Description:** This project was done for a class at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, different risk factors were calculated for pumpkin growth. These maps were made in order to figure out what was happening to the farmers pumpkins. There were several conclusions that could have been drawn, demogorgons, theft, or unsuitable conditions could have all caused the loss of pumpkins. Using an expression calculator, risk factors were amounted to numbers based off amount of risk, then added together to create a map with all risk factors. Gis network analysis was used in order to figure out most suitable routes that could've been taken by other farmers in order to get to farmer x's farm.
