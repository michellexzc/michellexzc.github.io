## Hexagonal Mapping 
**Description:** This project was done for a geographic information systems class at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This project used ArcGIS to build hexagonal maps in order to normaliza data, decreasing disparities on the map. The purpose of the maps was to show correlations between vacant lots and housing with rat sightings in Baltimore.

**_More information:_** *Due to the low perimeter to area ratio of the hexagon shape, hexagon maps reduce sampling bias. They are the most circular shaped polygon that is able to tessellate in order to form an evenly spaced grid.
